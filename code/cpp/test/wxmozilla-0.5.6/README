	wxMozilla - Mozilla Component for wxWindows
		wxmozilla.sf.net

This is just an initial release to try and capture anyone's
attention who is looking for a similar device and maybe
gather some development support.

This release just provides basic Mozilla browser
embedding into any wxWindows application with not much more
than basic URL loading.
